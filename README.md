## Description

During our study of JavaScript, we were given a challenge to code a password creator. It is to take input from prompts and create a password based on user inputs governing length, use of special characters, use of numbers, and use of upper and lower case letters. The given user story was: <br/>

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data<br/>
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria<br/>
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security<br/>

The acceptance criteria were:<br/>

GIVEN I need a new, secure password<br/>
WHEN I click the button to generate a password<br/>
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br/>
WHEN prompted for password criteria<br/>
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br/>
WHEN prompted for the length of the password<br/>
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br/>
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password<br/>
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br/>
WHEN I answer each prompt<br/>
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br/>
WHEN all prompts are answered<br/>
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br/>
WHEN the password is generated<br/>
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br/>
